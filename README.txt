Hello!
This is a bit of a side project to play around with some webscraping techniques.
If you find it useful, would like to help out, or want to contact me for any reason, you can reach me at isaac.fisher@nyu.edu
Feel free to take this framework and improve it! Just let me know so I can see what cool things people are doing.
CheersðŸ¥‚

Working list of used libraries:
spotipy

Procedure for authorizing this program:
Set local variables using these commands:
     export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=(your spotipy client id)
     export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=(your spotipy client secret)
These will set environment variables in your shell and allow you to run the program without explicitly typing your keys
