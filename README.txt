Hello!
This is a bit of a side project to play around with gathering API data. It will grab your recently played artists from spotify, then search ticketmaster for any available concerts near you.
If you find it useful, have advice, or want to contact me for any reason, you can reach me at isaac.fisher@nyu.edu
CheersðŸ¥‚

Before using, change the value of locationCode in resources/config.json to your local market code (found in resources/dmaIDs.csv)
